## Schrodinger Equation Solver

### Vision:
Our original vision was to build software that could model Schrodinger's wave equation through a GUI based on several canonical Hamiltonians and an initial condition. The GUI would plot the probability density function over time. To go into more detail we still want to be able to solve the equation for the free particle, harmonic oscillator, Poisson, and hydrogen atom Hamiltonians. We want to solve the free particle in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, the harmonic oscillator in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, the Poisson in 2 and 3 dimensions, and the hydrogen atom in 3 dimensions. In terms of the GUI we want to have an interface that can take in as input, which solver to use, the domain, the boundary conditions, the initial function, and what to graph (probability or wave function). We are also going to have error handling on the front end so that we can pass in clean input onto our actual solver. In terms of the functionality of the actual graphing, we still want to be able to plot both one, two, and three dimensional wave functions and probability densities and it should be animated with each time step.
